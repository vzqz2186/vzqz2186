Hello! I'm Daniel Vazquez. I have a Bachelors degree in Information Technology with a minor in Mathematics from Cumberland University in Lebanon, TN.

I have coding experience with Python, SQL, and a little bit of PHP and HTML. I’m currently on some personal data analysis projects with SQL and using the Tableau visualization software.

This GitHub is a collection of my personal projects, both from college and after.
